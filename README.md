ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,

Iâ€™m Rafael, I am 30 years old and live in Brazil. I am an Engineer changing to a Web Developer, and this new career is so exciting for me. 

Since I was young, I always loved games and follow news about technology, but when I reach to college that was I meet the programming. By the beginning, I started to program in C, but was too shallow because wasn't the focus of my graduation. Later I meet the operational research that surprises me with the programming logic.

After I graduated, I was disappointed with my job and I have an opportunity to take a web development course. With that I learned HTML, CSS, JS, libraries and frameworks like react and typescript.

Today, with all the knowledge that I have learned, I create my own projects, and participate in many others. Anyway, take a look and what I have done, and enjoy yourself.
